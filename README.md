## Project Description

CampusTrade Marketplace is an innovative e-commerce platform specifically designed for college campus communities, addressing the growing need for sustainable consumption among students. The platform facilitates peer-to-peer buying and selling of second-hand items within college campuses, creating a closed-loop marketplace that promotes sustainability while providing economic benefits to students. This project emerges from the recognition that college students frequently need to purchase items for their campus life, and simultaneously need to dispose of usable items when graduating or relocating.
